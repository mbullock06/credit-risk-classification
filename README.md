# 📊 Credit Risk Classification

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to credit risk classification, helping financial institutions evaluate whether a loan applicant is high-risk or healthy.

The workflow includes:

- Exploring and preprocessing the dataset

- Training classification models (Logistic Regression)

- Evaluating model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

- Deriving insights and discussing future improvements

📈 Results

- Logistic Regression provided interpretable results and solid recall for identifying high-risk loans.

- Recall was prioritized, since missing a high-risk loan is more costly than flagging a healthy one.

🔮 Next Steps

Perform hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Randomized Search)

Test advanced algorithms (Gradient Boosting)

Apply class imbalance techniques (SMOTE, class weighting)

Engineer domain-specific features to improve predictive power
